                  <h3>BROAD Declaration</h3>
                  Any enterprise in the world that is defined only by its
                  organizational system will have limited vitality, and will
                  expire due to market, social or political factors, or the
                  enterprise's own internal factors. To give an enterprise
                  unlimited vitality, we must build another system around the
                  organizational system; this is the cultural system.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  It is invisible, yet it is infinite. It transcends the
                  concepts of time and geography, and the concepts of
                  individuals, groups and races.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The BROAD cultural system will connect us with each other,
                  closely linking our feelings together, coordinating our
                  behavior and allowing us to complement each other's knowledge.
                  The BROAD cultural system will make us an indestructible
                  spiritual unity.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The BROAD cultural system will be established on the laws of
                  nature, and reveal the principle - centered corporate
                  philosophy. It will inspire our infinite wisdom and realize
                  human aspiration to pursue a higher quality life, and will not
                  fail the best company name in the world - BROAD!
