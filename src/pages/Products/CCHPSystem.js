              <li>Achieves zero emission with exhaust heat as power source.</li>
              <li>For more than 100 years, thermal power plants have been located a considerable distance from urban areas and waste heat can not be easily utilized. The energy loss from voltage fluctuation and long-distance power transmission has reached 2/3 in most cases, but this centralized energy model has been regarded as reasonable enough all the time.</li>
              <li>In 1999, BROAD pioneered the distributed energy model - the CCHP System powered by exhaust heat from a turbine generator. This system has been applied in more than 70 countries and has typically doubled the energy efficiency of most projects, and is equals to - zero energy cost for cooling and heating.</li>            
              <li>With the growing awareness of the climate change crisis, local distributed CCHP systems will ultimately displace the bulk grid ones, just as wireless communications largely replacing hard wired communications.</li>
